Exercise 9


1) Write a decorator function that prints the:
     - real world time taken to run the function,
     - process time used to run the function, and
     - size of the return value (using sys.getsizeof())

2) Apply this decorator to the following functions:
    for_loop() - Create an empty list and append the values 1 to 1,000,000 to the list using a for loop
    list_comp() - Use list comprehension to create a list of all values 1 to 1,000,000
    numpy_list() - Create a numpy array with all values 1 to 1,000,000
    pandas_list() - Create a pandas data frame with all values 1 to 1,000,000
    generator_list() - Use generator comprehension to create a generator of the values 1 to 1,000,000
                (generator comprehension is the same as list comprehension, but uses () instead of [])

3) For each function in #2, write a new function that produces the log10 of every number from 1 to 1,000,000.
    for_loop_log()
    list_com_log()
    numpy_list_log()
    pandas_list_log()
    generator_list_log()

There are many different ways to complete this assignment and there is not one single best way that I would prefer.
The purpose of this exercise is to practice implementing a decorator function and gain experience and knowlege of
several different modules. As long as your submission does not circumvent the purpose of this exercise and completes
tasks 1, 2 and 3, then you will receive full credit.
